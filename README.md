A collection of handy scripts I created when working with Android devices over `adb` on Windows

File | Description
--- | ---
Pull-AndroidPackage.ps1 | Pull APK by package to package name and version folder
current_package.bat | Get the package name of the currently focused app
screenshot.bat | Take a screenshot, include date-time in filename and adb pull to the current directory
